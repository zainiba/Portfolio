      <h3>Meditate With Me, Website, 2019 </h3>
      <p>This website is meant for people to stop what they are doing by a quick switch of the tab and meditate. The user begins painting the mandala and focusing on their breath which helps them become steadier and confident in their painting
        strokes. Once they complete the painting and press 'd', the mandala spins. This website draws parallels between the act of meditation and guides the user to meditate. The painting is similar to yoga in that it helps the person get ready to
        meditate by focusing on a single thing. Watching the mandala spin is supposed to aid in actually meditating.</p>

      <h3>Café Afterlife, Projection Mapping, 2019 </h3>
      <p>Café Afterlife is an immersive reality-blending projection installation. Ghouls and spirits come togther to enjoy drinks at a cafe just for them. This installation is a mix of spectral live-action recording and presented through digital

      <h3>Growth, Digital Video Installation Mock-Up, 2019</h3>
      <p>The two videos played on the walls show a transition from beautiful landscapes to views of equally beautiful cityscapes. Art like this is usually interpreted as saying industrialization is ugly, but I have shown that both are equally
        beautiful. </p>

        <h3>Drowning, Animation, 2019 </h3>
        <p>Drowning is a frame by frame animation that uses simple shapes and colors to represent how I felt during my spring semester. This animation was a semester long project, every two weeks I added a few frames that illustrated my feelings
          about those weeks.</p>

        <h3>On The Web, Website, 2019 </h3>
        <p>It is so easy to get lost on the Web, we move from one link to the next one that catches our interest. Capturing the users attention with words and images has been broken down into a science. The titles on this page are from my own
          expirience of Youtube binge. What seems like minutes turns into hours of web surfing and it doesn't look like you'll ever stop.</p>

        <h3>Reflected Reality, Flipbook, 2018 </h3>
        <p>Reflected Reality is a flipbook of a woman sitting in a train and watching landscapes pass by. The landscapes reflect the different stages of her life. Sometimes while going through the motions of life we forget to stop and reflect on what
          we are doing and the work we put in it to get there..</p>

        <h3>Google Stalks Me with My Permission, Epoxy, 18"x22" Birch Plywood, 2019 </h3>
        <p>In an attempt to quickly pass the terms and conditions prompt, a lot of us don't actually know or care to know how much privacy we have given up. Google Maps tracks everything about our day down to the minute. It also allows users to share
          where their itinerary for they day, how many times they have travelled to a different city, and their locations for the past years. It was shocking to see how much data they collected, most of the time I didn't even remember going to that
          place on that specific day. It is like having a stalker in the palm of my hands. In this piece, I gathered about 40 days worth of data and laser cut the data into an 18-in x 22-in plywood, filling my route with blue epoxy. I omitted the
          county and street names to preserve whatever privacy I could. </p>

        <h3>Bicycle, 8"x14", Birch Plywood, 2018 </h3>
        <p>This is a bicycle and stand I made using lasercut wood and attaching the pieces with glue and cnc cuts. The rear wheel on the bicycle spins by turning the pedals, I wrapped a rubber band around the gears of the pedal and wheel. </p>

          <h3>Scaling Pixel, Website, 2019 </h3>
        </a>
        <p>Scaling Pixel is a webiste created using p5.js. They increasing scale and changing colors of the squares create an immersive and memerising expirience. This piece memorializes the expirience of becoming engrossed in a book. Like pixels,
          the words come together to create images that we don't want to look away from. </p>
