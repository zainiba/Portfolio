<h4>
  <p style="text-indent: 40px">
  I am constantly learning about who I am and what I like to do with each project I work on. I am interested in the natural world. I like to critique and create parodies of societal norms in my art. I am learning to push my boundaries by incorporating things that are uncomfortable and unexplored in my art.
  </p>
  <p style="text-indent: 40px">
  Videos that people see online or in movies always seem so easy and people don't really think about the process behind the scenes. I wanted to approach this by showing my audience a video where you can see everything go wrong in my “Unconventional” video. The “Growth” project aligned with my interests thinking about subjects in the progression of time. I have learned that I like working on projects that include changes based on the passage of time. In regards to the “Honeymart” website, I approached my strong dislike for ads in an interesting way. My abhorrence towards ads pushed me to create something that was full of them. Oddly enough, I became appreciative of the effort that goes into creating ads but I still don't like the approach they take.
